Underlying properties of a tree:
    adding an edge that connects two vertices creates an unique cycle
    removing an edge from a tree breaks it into two separate subtrees

Cut property:
    A cut of a graph is a partition of its vertices into two non-empty disjoint
sets. 
    A crossing edge is the edge that connects one vertice in one set and another
vertice in another set. 
    And typically we specify a cut by specifying two sets of vertices.
